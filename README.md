Hey! I'm a 4th year CS student at UWaterloo, with a focus on backend development, Machine Learning and AI. I'm Currently seeking Summer and Fall 2024 internships.

I have extensive experience in creating distributed systems with Python and C++, building scalable backend servers with Flask, Django, Docker, SQL, AWS, full-stack applications with React.js, Node.js and TypeScript, and creating ML/AI models with PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Pandas and Tensorflow from past internships and side projects.
