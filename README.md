I'm 4th year CS student at UWaterloo, with a focus on distributed systems and machine learning. I'm Currently seeking Summer and Fall 2024 internships.

I have experience building distributed systems with Python and Go, working with data tools like Kafka, RabbitMQ, full-stack applications with React, Node and TypeScript, and creating AI models with PyTorch/Tensorflow from past internships and side projects.
