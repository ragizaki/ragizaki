Hey! I'm a 4th year CS student at UWaterloo, with a focus on backend development, Machine Learning and AI. I'm Currently seeking Summer and Fall 2024 internships.

I have extensive experience in building distributed systems with Python and Go, working with data tools like Kafka, RabbitMQ, full-stack applications with React.js, Node.js and TypeScript, and creating ML/AI models with PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Pandas and Tensorflow from past internships and side projects.
