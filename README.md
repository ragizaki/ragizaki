I'm a 3rd year Computer Science Student at the University of Waterloo, with a passion for Software Development and a growing interest in AI. Most recently interned as a Software Developer at <a href="https://www.empire.ca/">Empire Life</a>. I create full-stack apps, and am currently creating Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch.

Seeking Fall 2023 internships!
