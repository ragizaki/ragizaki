Hey! I'm a 4th year CS student at UWaterloo, with a passion for Software Development, Machine Learning and AI. I'm Currently seeking Summer and Fall 2024 internships.

I have extensive experience in creating distributed systems with Python and C++, building scalable backend servers with Flask, Django, Docker, SQL, AWS, and creating ML/AI models with PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Pandas and Tensorflow from past internships and side projects.
